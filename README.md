# Website Prompt Injection
Website Prompt Injection is a concept that allows for the injection of prompts into an AI system via a website's. This technique exploits the interaction between users, websites, and AI systems to execute specific prompts that influence AI behavior.

# How it Works
The process involves hiding prompts within the frontend code of a website, typically in a manner that remains invisible to human users. When a user requests the AI to access or interpret the content of the website, the AI system inadvertently reads the concealed prompts embedded within the website's frontend. 
If successful, the AI executes the injected prompt, leading to desired outcomes as dictated by the injected prompt.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of Website Prompt Injection is to demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities of AI systems when interacting with web-based interfaces. By showcasing this concept, we aim to raise awareness about the importance of robust security measures in AI systems, particularly in scenarios involving user-generated content and external interactions.

# Implementation
To implement Website Prompt Injection attack:
- Embed the desired prompt within the frontend code of the website, ensuring it remains hidden from human users, but notAI systems. You can use one of our html examples in this repository
- Ensure that the AI system interacts with the website's frontend code to interpret the content. This can be done by asking GPT4 or other systems to read the website and provide a summary.
- Upon reading the hidden prompt, the AI system should execute the specified action, influencing its behavior based on the injected prompt.

# Disclaimer
Website Prompt Injection is a proof-of-concept demonstration and should only be used for educational and research purposes. Engaging in unauthorized access or manipulation of AI systems without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. We do not condone the use of this technique for malicious purposes.
